Does duplicate inside playlist also add a song
Yes i think it adds a song that is owned by you.

song clear button doesn't do anything at the moment.

reconfigure search to make it less strict and allow incomplete

need to make guest icon align with specs

disable playlist and song renders on account screens

I should have had a guest user because now there is a boolean for every playlist and song. (nope now fixed)

make sign in screen only take up the middle.

drag n drop (yknow what low priority)
